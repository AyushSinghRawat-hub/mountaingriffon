        <p>The Char Dham of Uttarakhand—Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri—is a sacred pilgrimage circuit nestled in the Himalayas. Each shrine holds immense spiritual significance and offers breathtaking natural beauty.<br>
          <b>Badrinath</b> <br>
          Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, Badrinath is located at 10,170 feet on the banks of the Alaknanda River. Surrounded by the Nar and Narayan ranges, it is a symbol of salvation and divine energy. Pilgrims also visit Tapt Kund and Vasudhara Falls nearby.<br>
          <b>Kedarnath </b> <br>
          One of the twelve Jyotirlingas, Kedarnath is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Set at 11,755 feet near the Mandakini River, the ancient temple is an architectural marvel amidst snow-clad peaks. Its remote location adds to its spiritual allure.<br>
          <b>Gangotri</b> <br>
          Gangotri is the origin of the holy Ganga River, dedicated to Goddess Ganga. At 10,200 feet, the temple sits amidst serene Himalayan landscapes. Pilgrims also trek to Gaumukh, the source of the river at the Gangotri Glacier.<br>
          <b>Yamunotri</b> <br>
          The source of the Yamuna River, Yamunotri is dedicated to Goddess Yamuna. At 10,800 feet, the shrine is surrounded by rugged peaks and hot springs like Surya Kund, offering spiritual solace and stunning views.</p>

        <h4>Day 1: Haridwar/Dehradun-Barkot</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Distance Covered: 210 km</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On Day 1, we embark on a scenic drive from Haridwar/Dehradun to Barkot, covering 210 kilometres. The journey takes us through the lush, winding roads of Mussoorie, offering several opportunities to stop and explore. Along the way, we visit the tranquil Mussoorie Lake and the iconic Kempty Falls.
        Kempty Falls serves as the perfect lunch spot, where visitors can enjoy quality food alongside stunning views—a combination that may not be available later in the journey. After a refreshing break, we continue our drive directly to Barkot and check into our hotel.
        Situated at an altitude of 1,220 meters, Barkot welcomes us with its charming hill station ambiance. The pleasant weather here is a highlight, with summer temperatures ranging between 25°C and 30°C. In winter, days remain comfortable, while nights can be slightly chilly, with temperatures dropping to 5°C to 10°C.
        The evening is kept free for relaxation, allowing us to rejuvenate and prepare for the activities planned on Day 3, including the Prahalad Yatra to Yamunotri. Dinner will be served at the hotel, followed by an overnight stay in Barkot.</p>

        <h4>Day 2: Barkot–Yamunotri–Barkot</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Distance covered (by road): 36 km (one way)</li>
          <li>Distance covered (by trek): 6 km (one way)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The day begins with a hearty breakfast before we set out for Janki Chatti or Phool Chatti, located 36 kilometers from Barkot. From here, we embark on a 6-kilometer trek to Yamunotri, the first shrine of the Chardham circuit. The trek can be undertaken on foot, by horse, or via Doli (charges not included).
        The trail offers stunning views of Himalayan vegetation, featuring dense clusters of conifers, birch, fir, rhododendron, and even some regional cactus species. Upon reaching Yamunotri, we engage in the sacred tradition of making Prasad by cooking rice in the steaming waters of a natural hot spring.
        The Yamunotri region is known for its cold climate, with summer temperatures peaking at a comfortable 18°C, while winters can be extremely chilly. Yamunotri also features several noteworthy hot water springs, including the Jamunabai Kund, where the water is warm enough for a refreshing dip, and Surya Kund, a site of religious significance.
        Visitors then proceed to offer prayers at the Divyashila and the Yamunotri Temple, an ancient structure built in the 19th century. Despite having been destroyed twice, the temple has been carefully restored and continues to be a revered destination for pilgrims.
        The return journey to Janki Chatti is equally picturesque, offering magnificent views of the Yamuna River. Afterward, we drive back to Barkot, where dinner is served, followed by an overnight stay at the hotel.</p>

        <h4>Day 3: Barkot-Uttarkashi</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Distance covered: 100 km</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The day begins with an early rise and a hearty breakfast to energize us for the journey ahead. With enthusiasm, we embark on a scenic 100-kilometer drive to Uttarkashi. Upon arrival, we check into our hotel, enjoy a delicious lunch, and take a short rest before heading out to explore.
        The highlight of the day is a visit to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, a revered site in Uttarkashi, a city situated on the banks of the Ganga. Known for its extremes in weather, Uttarkashi experiences hot summers with temperatures ranging between 30°C and 35°C, while winters bring a distinct chill to the air.
        The Kashi Vishwanath Temple, reconstructed in 1857, is a spiritual landmark. Across from it lies the Shakti Temple, famous for its towering 6-meter-high Trishul, crafted from iron and copper. In addition to these temples, the Vishwanath complex houses shrines dedicated to deities such as Ganeshji, Markandeya Rishi, and Sakshi Gopal.
        The aartis performed here in the early morning and evening are a soulful and integral part of the temple’s rituals. After offering prayers and exploring the spiritual essence of the area, we return to the hotel to unwind. Dinner is served, followed by a restful overnight stay.</p>

        <h4>Day 4: Uttarkashi-Gangotri-Uttarkashi</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Distance covered: 100 km (each side)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Today, we make the uphill journey to Gangotri, which is situated at an astonishing height of 3,048 meters. We take a packed breakfast with us to enjoy on the way. We stop at a hot spring named Garamkund at Ganganani for a holy dip quite unlike any other spiritual experience. Afterward, we take the Harsil Valley route straight to our objective destination of the day –Gangotri. We take our time and enjoy the ravishing hamlet valley of Harsil, with unprecedented views of the Himalayas, and its alpine vegetation consisting mainly of clusters of deodar and fir. Owing to its height and abundance of vegetation, the weather at Gangotri is almost always cold. The temperature even in summers ranges between 10 and 20 degrees. Light layers are recommended while making the trip. During winters, because of heavy snowfall, the place is closed and inaccessible. We soon reach Gangotri and take a moment to pray and bathe in the holy waters of river Ganga (referred to as the Bhagirathi, at its point of origin). The Gangotri temple (established in the 18th century), is situated on the right bank of the mighty river. After offering our prayers, completing the pooja rituals, and taking some time to enjoy the view presented to you in the lap of nature, we take a beautiful late sunset drive back to Uttarkashi and spend the night there. Dinner and Overnight Stay at the hotel.</p>

        <h4>Day 5: Uttarkashi - Guptkashi</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Distance covered: 220 km</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After enjoying a hearty breakfast, we embark on the drive to Guptkashi, a place steeped in spiritual significance. The name "Guptkashi," meaning "Hidden Benaras," is linked to the legend of Lord Shiva hiding from the Pandavas at this location.
        Guptkashi is a delightful summer destination, with temperatures rarely exceeding 30°C. However, winters here can be quite chilly, adding a contrasting charm to the region. The journey takes us through the Moolgarh and Lambgoan route, offering mesmerizing views of the Mandakini River, which originates from Kedarnath. This connection to Kedarnath enhances the spiritual energy of the trip.
        While driving along the serene river, we stop at the ArdhNarishwar Temple, a revered site in Guptkashi, to offer prayers and soak in its peaceful ambiance. Afterward, we check into our hotel, where we take the rest of the evening to relax and rejuvenate.
        Dinner is served at the hotel, followed by an overnight stay, as we prepare for the next leg of our journey.</p>

        <h4>Day 6: Guptkashi-Kedarnath</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Distance covered (by road): 30 km</li>
          <li>Distance covered (by trek): 19 km</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Day 6 is one of the most eventful days of the entire Chardham trip. Our destination for the day is Kedarnath, possibly the most well-known and widely travelled Dham in our itinerary. According to old legends, Kedarnath is the place where Lord Shiva granted the Pandavas redemption after many prayers and requests, upon the end of the Kurukshetra war. “Kedar” is one of the many other alternative names for Lord Shiva. The Kedarnath shrine boasts the entire robust Kedarnath mountain range in the background and is situated at one of the most majestic locations possible. Because it stands tall at 3,583 meters, the temperature witnessed at the Kedarnath shrine is almost always cold. Light to semi-heavy layers of clothing are recommended even during the summer months. During winters, the weather is so cold that it is not even widely traveled to, and because the climatic conditions can be risky, it is even avoided. There are two main ways of reaching the Kedarnath shrine. One could either take the helicopter (Cost not included in the package), for which you will be dropped at the helipad in the morning soon after breakfast. This route, though quicker, stands on the relatively expensive side. Another way to reach the shrine is by trek. You will be driven to Sonprayag, after which a local jeep to Gaurikund will seamlessly bring you to your starting point for the trek. To make your way back, you will have to follow the same route and take a local jeep to Sonprayag again. Regardless of which mode you choose to opt for, you may inform the driver about the duration of your flight or trek, so he can find a suitable place to park and pick you up the next day without any hassle. After witnessing the shrine and spending some time at the Dham, we check into a Camp for the night.</p>

        <h4>Day 7: Kedarnath - Guptkashi</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Distance covered (by road): 30 km</li>
          <li>Distance covered (by trek): 19 km</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The day begins with a serene and uplifting pooja, followed by a delightful breakfast. After checking out from the hotel, we commence our journey back from Kedarnath to Sonprayag. From there, our driver meets us at the designated spot, and we proceed to visit the sacred Triyuginarayan Temple, a site of immense spiritual significance.
        Following this visit, we continue our drive to Guptkashi, where we check back into our hotel. The rest of the day is kept free, allowing ample time to reflect on the spiritual essence of the journey so far, relax, and rejuvenate in preparation for the days ahead.</p>

        <h4>Day 8: Guptkashi- Badrinath</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Distance covered: 215 km</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our last Dham for the trip, i.e. Badrinath, is the objective of our day today. After breakfast, we drive straight to Badrinath and check into our hotel. The maximum average temperature at Badrinath is around 15 degrees, and the minimum would be around 8 degrees. Extra layers of clothing are always required for Badrinath, regardless of the time of the year. During winter, it is mostly closed to tourists. One of the most significant holy rituals of Badrinath is taking a bath in Taptkund. After this, one may embark on sightseeing or the darshan of Badrivishal, followed by the beautiful aarti in the evening. In the interim period, you may take the time to explore other popular gems of the region, namely Mana village (Indo-Mongolian tribe inhabited), Bhimkund, Matamoorti, Vyasgufa (the cave where Ved Vyas is said to have composed the Mahabharata), and the mouth of the Saraswati river. Most of these points of interest are located within three to five kilometers of Badrinath After spending time at the shrine and witnessing one of the most spiritually-charged aartis you will ever witness, Overnight stay in Badrinath or Joshimath.</p>

        <h4>Day 9: Badrinath - Rishikesh/Haridwar</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Distance covered: 298 km</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The day begins with a breathtaking sunrise at Badrinath, followed by the serene morning aarti at the temple. After breakfast, we set off on the journey to Rishikesh or Haridwar. Upon arrival, your driver will drop you at your designated hotel or the railway station, marking the conclusion of this spiritually enriching journey.</p>
